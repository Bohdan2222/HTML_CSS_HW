<p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a href="">Scottish
    novelist</a> and playwright
    J.
    M. Barrie. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up,
    Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island
    of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates,
    mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside
    Neverland.

    Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In
    addition to two distinct works by Barrie, The Little White Bird (1902, with chapters
    13â€“18 published in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens in 1906), and the West End stage
    play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up (1904, which expanded into the 1911
    novel Peter and Wendy), the character has been featured in a variety of media and
    merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include several
    films, television series and many other works.</p>
<p>Barrie commissioned <a href="">a statue of Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor <a href="">George
    Frampton</a>, which was
    erected overnight in Kensington Gardens on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children
    of London. <sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup> Six other statues have been cast from
    the original mould
        and
    displayed
    around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on <a href="">a series of UK postage
        stamps</a> issued
    by the Royal Mail on the centenary of Barrie's creation of the
    character.<sup><a>[2]</a></sup></p>
